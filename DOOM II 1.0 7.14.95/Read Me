Notes.Doom II / Macintosh was compiled under CodeWarrior 5.0 for the 68K version, and under MPW's PPCC (MPW Shell version 3.4a7) for the Power PC version. The resulting "fat" application was then put together "by hand" using ResEdit to copy the 68K-specific resources into the PPCC application. Included resources were the CODE and DATA resource types.The final SIZE resource was set to 4500K minimum, and 8000K preferred application heap sizes.The final version, 1.0, is compatible with Version 1.9 of Doom II for the IBM PC, and with 1.9-compatible WAD files.The AppleTalk Socket Listener is a 68K-compiled resource, since the current version of AppleTalk will not allow a PowerPC-native code resource.Additionally, the 68K blits were coded in assembly, assembled under MPW, and included in the 68K project. The blits for the PowerPC are in C. Fixed point routines are in in-line assembly for 68K, and in C for the PowerPC.
