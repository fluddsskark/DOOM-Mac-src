This condition can occur ONLY if an ;** "old"/"Classic" 68K model application is attempting to use the CFM API directly.;**;** The routine BindQDGlobalsList must be called IMMEDIATELY before the application;** initialization call of QuickDraw's InitGraf() routine, WITH THE SAME parameter ;** passed to InitGraf.  BindQDGlobalsList resolves the linked list of A5Worlds;** created by LinkupQDGlobals.  This will cause all the A5Worlds to have a valid;** pointer at A5+0 to the same QuickDraw Globals.;**;** Shared Libraries that have "Global" sharing (i.e 1 copy of data in system heap);** must have customized Init Routines and probably will require a private copy of ;** the quickdraw globals that are created manually and A5+0 initialized without;** calling QuickDraw's InitGraf() IF such libraries are to call QuickDraw (directly;** or indirectly) at all.  The most likely case of a "data only" globally shared ;** fragment will not need to have an init routine that fixes up A5+0, since no code;** will ever execute with A5 referencing its A5World.;** ;** pascal OSErr LinkupQDGlobals(void);;** pascal void BindQDGlobalsList(void* globalPtr);;** ;;			IMPORT			LINKUPQDGLOBALS;			IMPORT			BINDQDGLOBALSLIST;	ENDIF
