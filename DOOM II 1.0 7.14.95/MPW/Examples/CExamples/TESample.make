The fundamental TextEdit #	toolbox calls and TextEdit autoscroll are demonstrated. It #	also shows how to create and maintain scrollbar controls.##	It does not by any means demonstrate all the techniques you #	need for a large application. In particular, Sample does not #	cover exception handling, multiple windows/documents, #	sophisticated memory management, printing, or undo. All of #	these are vital parts of a normal full-sized application.##	This application is an example of the form of a Macintosh #	application; it is NOT a template. It is NOT intended to be #	used as a foundation for the next world-class, best-selling, #	600K application. A stick figure drawing of the human body may #	be a good example of the form for a painting, but that does not #	mean it should be used as the basis for the next Mona Lisa.##	We recommend that you review this program or Sample before #	beginning a new application. Sample is a simple app. which doesnÕt #	use TextEdit or the Control Manager.## 	You can define {SymOptions} as "-sym on" or "-sym off" for use with SADE# 	We also recommend requiring prototypes for all functionsCOptions = -r {SymOptions} -d OBSOLETECObjs	=	TESample.c.o ¶			TESampleGlue.a.o ¶			"{Libraries}"MacRuntime.o ¶			"{Libraries}"Interface.oTESample		ÄÄ {CObjs} TESample.make		Link -o {Targ} {CObjs} {SymOptions}		SetFile {Targ} -t APPL -c 'MOOT' -a BTESample		ÄÄ TESample.r TESample.h TESample.make		Rez -rd -append -o {Targ} TESample.rTESample.c.o	ÄÄ TESample.c TESample.make
