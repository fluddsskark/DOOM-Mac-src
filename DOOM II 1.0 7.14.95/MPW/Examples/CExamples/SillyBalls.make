It is about two pages of code, and does nothing more than open#	a color window and draw randomly colored ovals in the window.#	#	The purpose is to show how to get some initial results with Color QuickDraw.#	It is a complete program and is very short to be as clear as possible.#	#	It does not have an Event Loop.  It is not fully functional in the sense that#	it does not do all the things you would expect a well behaved Macintosh #	program to do, like size the window naturally, have an event loop, use menus, #	etc.##	See Sample and TESample for the general structure and MultiFinder techniques that#	we recommend that you use when building a new application.## MPW 3.0 and later: We override the default COptions to turn on strict prototyping;#	add '-r' to your UserStartup when you tire of the warning from Make.# If you are using MPW 3.0 or later, uncomment the following line:#COptions = -r# For MPW 2.0 we use the following line so that the the complete interfaces are there:COptions = -d __ALLNU__Objs		=	SillyBalls.c.o ¶				"{Libraries}"Interface.o ¶				"{Libraries}"MacRuntime.o SillyBalls	Ä	{Objs} SillyBalls.make				Link -o {Targ} {Objs}				SetFile {Targ} -t APPL -c '????'
