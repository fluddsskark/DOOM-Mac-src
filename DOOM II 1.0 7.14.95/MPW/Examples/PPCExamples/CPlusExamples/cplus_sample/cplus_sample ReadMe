This very simple sample demonstrates how to build a C++ application using Macintosh on RISCtools.  If you have access to the MPW tool "CPlus" then you can also build a 68K versionof the sample and combine them into a 'FAT' application containing both 68K and PowerMacintosh versions.To build the Power Macintosh version use:make -f cplus_sample.make   To build the 68K Macintosh version use:make -f cplus_sample.make cplus_sample.68KTo build the 'FAT' version (combined 68K and Power Macintosh versions) use:make -f cplus_sample.make cplus_sample.FATIf you wish to build a debuggable version, add the option "-d SymOpt=on" to thecommand line. make -e -f cplus_sample.make -d SymOpt=on  # (-e forces everything to be rebuilt).
