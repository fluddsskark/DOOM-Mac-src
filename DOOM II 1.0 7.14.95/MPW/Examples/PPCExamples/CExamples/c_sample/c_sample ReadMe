This very simple sample demonstrates how to build a C application using Macintosh on RISCtools.  You can also build a 68K version of the sample and combine them into a 'FAT'application containing both 68K and Power Macintosh versions.To build the Power Macintosh version use:make -f c_sample.make >temptempThis produces the application c_sample.ppc that is only runnable on a Power Macintosh.To build the 68K Macintosh version use:make -f c_sample.make c_sample.68K>temptempThis produces the application c_sample.68K that is runnable on both a 68K and PowerMacintosh.To build the 'FAT' version (combined 68K and Power Macintosh versions) use:make -f c_sample.make c_sample.FAT>temptempThis produces the 'Fat' application c_sample.FAT that is runnable on both a 68K and PowerMacintosh.  (As a side effect, c_sample.ppc and c_sample.68K are built.)If you wish to build a debuggable version, add the option "-d SymOpt=on" to thecommand line. make -e -f c_sample.make -d SymOpt=on>temp  # (-e forces everything to be rebuilt).tempThis will rebuild the application with debugging turned on.  It will produce the filesc_sample.ppc and c_sample.xSYM.  After you have the debugger properly installed on bothyour 68K and Power Macintosh computers, you can double click c_sample.xSYM on your 68K Macintosh to start up Debugger. Next, launch the application under the debugger's control on the Power Macintosh by holding down 'ctrl' while double clickingc_sample.ppc on the Power Macintosh.
