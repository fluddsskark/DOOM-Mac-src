It doesn't bother;	with saving registers A0 and D0, because they are trashed;	anyway by TextEdit.;		case	on		seg	'Controls'ASMTECLIKLOOP	proc	export		import	gDefaultClikLoopUPP:DATA		import	CTEClikLoop		movem.l	D1-D2/A1,-(SP)	;D0 and A0 need not be saved.		movea.l	gDefaultClikLoopUPP,A0		jsr	(A0)		;Execute TextEdit's default clikLoop.		movem.l	(SP)+,D1-D2/A1	; restore the world as it was		movem.l	D1-D2/A1,-(SP)	;D0 and A0 need not be saved.		jsr	CTEClikLoop		movem.l	(SP)+,D1-D2/A1	; restore the world as it was		moveq	#1,D0		; clear the zero flag so TextEdit keeps going		rts		ENDP************ASMNOCARET	PROC	EXPORT		move.l	(A7)+,D0		rts		ENDP************		END
