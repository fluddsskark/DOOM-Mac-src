Since there is no other cleanup needed at this point if an** error is detected, this form of error-handling is acceptable.  If more** sophisticated error recovery is needed, an exception mechanism, such as is** provided by Signals, can be used. *//*****************************************************************************//* NOTE:  The “g” prefix is used to emphasize that a variable is global. */OSType	gDocCreator;Boolean	gQuitApplication;Boolean gNoFinderPrint;short	gMenuBar   = rMenuBar;short	gAppleMenu = mApple;extern Boolean		gHasAppleEvents, gNoDefaultDocument;extern RgnHandle	gCursorRgn;extern short		gPrintPage;extern OSType		gAppWindowType;extern TreeObjHndl	gWindowFormats;extern DescType		gAERequiredType;typedef void (*callBack)(void);/*****************************************************************************//*****************************************************************************//* Given minHeap and minSpace values, get stuff going.
