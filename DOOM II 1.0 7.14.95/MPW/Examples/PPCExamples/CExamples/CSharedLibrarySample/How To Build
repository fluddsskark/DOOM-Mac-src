This example demonstrates how to create a shared library on the PowerMacintosh.  Since CFM is not present on the 68K Macintosh, no 68K versionis created.To build the C Shared Library Example:make -e -f ShLibExample.makeTo build the C Shared Library Example suitable for debugging:make -e -f ShLibExample.make -d SymOpt=onThe application (ShLibExample) will run successfully only if it's shared library (SharedLib) can be found.  The shared library willbe found if it is in the same folder as the application, or if itis in the system extensions folder, or in an immediate sub-folderof the system extensions folder.If the shared library is not found when the application is launched,the Power Macintosh will complain that it is missing a piece called"SharedLib".
