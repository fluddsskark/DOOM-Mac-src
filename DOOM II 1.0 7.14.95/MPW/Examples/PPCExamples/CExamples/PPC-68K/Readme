This folder contains an example of attaching an MPW 68K library to a POwerPC application.The technique involves 4 steps:  1) Creating a table of Universal Procedure Pointers, with one pointer per function in     the library. This table goes inside the PowerPC application, and is exported via the CFM.  2) Creating a "wrapper" routine which turns the MPW library into a stand-alone 68K code     resource. This routine needs to 1) ask the CFM for the location of the table (exported	 from the application), and 2) place 68K pointers to the library routines into the table.	 This routine is called once, when the code resource is loaded.  3) Loading and executing the code resource from the PowerPC application. This involves     using Mixed Mode to call the "wrapoper" routine which builds the table.  4) Finally, using Mixed Mode to call through the Univerasl Procedure Pointers which     were placed into the table.	 To build the example, use "BuildProgram MainApp", or select "Build…" from the Build menuand specify "MainApp." This will build a 68K library (from Library.c and Library.h), a 68K code resource (from Library, WrapperTable.h, and Wrapper.c), and an application whichcontains the code resource.
