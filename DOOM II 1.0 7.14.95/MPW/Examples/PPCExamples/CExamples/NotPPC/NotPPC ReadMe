#-----------------------------------------------------------------------##																		##						NotPPC - Sample Application						##																		##						©1993, 1994 Apple Computer, Inc.				##																		##-----------------------------------------------------------------------#NotPPC is a tiny 68K application that you can combine with your PowerMacintosh application to avoid the annoying "System Error -192: ResourceNot Found" that occurs when you try to run a Power Macintosh applicationon a 68K Macintosh.When run on a 68K Macintosh, NotPPC puts up a simple alert saying that theapplication program is designed for Power Macintosh computers and is notcompatible with this 68K Macintosh.NotPPC is created with a single segment named 'PPCOnly'.  You might be ableto use 'PPCOnly' to differentiate between a Power Macintosh only applicationversus a FAT application (such as from an installer).To include this capability in your Power Macintosh application:1)	Build the NotPPC App using the NotPPC.make makefile.	2)	Add the following line to your Power Macintosh application's resource	description (.r) file...	Include "NotPPC";	This copies the resources from NotPPC to your Power Macintosh	Application, resulting in a "Fat" application.  Note that there are	other (equivalent) ways of creating "Fat" applications.
