What's new in StuffIt Expander==============================This document briefly outlines new features and enhancements that have been added to the StuffIt Expander package.  For more detailed information and instructions please read the file titled ÒStuffIt Expanderª Read MeÓ located in the ÒRead Us First!Ó folder.StuffIt Expander 3.5.2--------------------New Features------------* Users of System 7.5 can now drop folders and/or disks on the Expander icon to expand an entire folder or disk worth of files.* Incorporated support for Rival.  Users of Rival will have their newly expanded files automatically checked for viruses.Bug Fixes---------* Fixed a problem where StuffIt archives would not get expanded.* Users of a 68000 based Macintoshes (MacPlus, PB100, etc.) will no longer have problems when decoding MacBinary files.StuffIt Expander 3.5.1----------------------This version does not unexpectedly expire. StuffIt Expander 3.5--------------------New Key Modifiers-----------------While dragging and dropping a file on StuffIt Expander...	* Holding down the control key will delete the original file when expansion is finished.	* Holding down the option key brings up the one-time preferences dialog.  Any preferences you set in the preferences dialog will be used only for that expansion. When choosing ÒExpandÉÓ from the File menu...	* Holding down the Shift key will cause Expander to scan the "Watch Folder" before the designated time.  * Holding down the command key will bring up a special "Expand folder" dialog.  After selecting a folder, Expander will scan the folder and expand any files it can.New Features------------* Expander will now expand MacBinary files.* New Preferences Dialog with a whole new look! * You can now specify Expander to either prompt for a destination, or use a default folder for expansion.  That destination will apply to all files to be expanded.* When aborting an expansion, you can now choose to abort only that file or all files.* You can now paste passwords into the password dialog while expanding encrypted archives.* Expander will now auto-rename files and folders to prevent colliding with expanded items of the same name.* Expander will now expand the result file of an expand. In other words, users who drop a Òfoo.sit.hqxÓ file on Expander will see a BinHex expansion, and then a StuffIt archive expansion, leaving you with a fully expanded file!  You may also choose to turn this option off.* If Expander is expanding a .cpt archive that contains comments, the comments are written to a seperate text file at the same level as the expanded items.Other Improvements------------------* Expander now performs better in conditions such as low memory & lack of disk space.* If an error occurs when Expander is in the background, it will now notify you.* The Watch Folder feature is now more reliable.* Using Expander from AppleScript, UserLand Frontier (and other scripting systems) is now more reliable.* Added additional support for Macintosh Easy Open.AppleLink Package Expansion--------------------------AppleLink package expansion is no longer supported with StuffIt Expander, the stand-alone freeware application.  However, users of DropStuff with Expander Enhancer will be able to expand AppleLink packages, as well as a host of other compression formats.
