About ConvertProjects---------------------ConvertProjects is a UserLand Frontier droplet application that creates MW C/C++ PPC projects based on Think C/C++ projects. Since the convertor is implemented entirely as a script, it can be modified and customized by owners of Frontier. ConvertProjects is compatible with Frontier Runtime (shareware $35 after 30-day trial).Installation------------Before using the droplet, make sure that you have the latest MWC.Frontier verb table (included in this package) installed. You'll also need the verbs for Think Project Manager; install Think.Frontier from your TPM folder if you haven't already done so.Using ConvertProjects---------------------To convert your Think projects, just drag one more more projects, or folders containing projects, onto the ConvertProjects icon. The droplet will process all of the projects found in or within the set of dragged items.The droplet will launch TPM and CodeWarrior as necessary to convert the projects. If you have enough memory to run both at once, it will do so. Otherwise, it will launch and quit the two environments alternately.What is Created---------------For each TPM project, the droplet will create a MW C/C++ PPC project, replacing ".¹" in the original project's name with "PPC.¹" (or simply appending the PPC.¹ suffix). All TEXT files in the original project are added to the PPC project. MacTraps is mapped to InterfaceLib, and any library containing "ANSI" is mapped to ANSI C++.PPC.Lib. MWCRuntime.Lib is added unconditionally.All applicable settings from the TPM Set Project Type dialog -- file name, type & creator, resource flags, etc. -- are set in the MW project. If the source project is not an application, the MW project type is set to Code Resource and the resource settings are converted.Finally, if the target of the source project exists, and an alias to it is created as the MWproject.rsrc. The allows you to easily create a fat binary from the new project.Issues------ConvertProjects relies on TPM to specify the location of its files. It will always find files that are located in the project's folder, but to locate other files, TPM's filespecs must be up to date. If the project has not been built in the current environment (disk location) since it was created or last had its objects removed, you can force it to update its path infomration by doing a Make, unchecking "QuickScan", clicking on "Use Disk", then "Don't Make".The droplet currently does not create MW C/C++ 68K projects, but it could easily to extended to do so. If you'd like to see this, or have any other suggestioned, let us hear from you!Copyright---------This droplet is copyright 1994 UserLand Software.
