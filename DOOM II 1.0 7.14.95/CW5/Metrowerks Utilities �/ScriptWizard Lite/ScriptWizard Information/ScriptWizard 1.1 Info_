ScriptWizard and ScriptWizard LITE Ð version 1.1We had intended to have ScriptWizard LITE version 1.1 ready in time for the CodeWarrior CW5 CD. Unfortunately this was not possible, so we will make arrangements to post a free-of-charge netborne upgrade to ScriptWizard LITE 1.1 on all major on-line services, during the lifespan of the CW5 CD.Users of the full version of ScriptWizard will be contacted by Full Moon Software as soon as the upgrade is ready. If you purchased ScriptWizard after the 1st January 1995 you'll be able to upgrade for a nominal fee (to cover manufacturing costs and shipping).There are a lot of improvements and enhancements in version 1.1. Here are some details...Improved Text EditingOK, we admit it. Text editing in version 1.0.1 of ScriptWizard can be a bit sluggish, particularly under emulation mode on Power Macs and on older, slower, 68020/30 Macintoshes. Version 1.1 speeds up text editing significantly.Accellerated for Power MacintoshUsers of Power Macintosh computers will enjoy accellerated performance with the 'native' version of ScriptWizard.Enhanced User InterfaceThe Toolbar can be flipped between horizontal and vertical orientations, and can be hidden if you wish.You can resize Dictionary Window and Variable Watcher panes, customising the windows.The Progress window is now non-modal, and can be hidden if you prefer.The Results window displays styled text.Enhanced Script DebuggingVersion 1.1 adds extra facilities for in-depth script debugging and true single-stepping.The Variable Watcher permits examination of variable values of any length.Apple event messages and sub-routine calls can be sent from one script window to another, facilitating the debugging of mini-applications (applets and droplets). At last, you can test 'open' and 'idle' handlers!Scriptable and RecordableScriptWizard 1.1 is scriptable and recordable.And more...We've listened to user and reviewer feedback, and enhanced the software in response to it. We feel sure you'll prefer to use ScriptWizard in comparison to other scripting environments.Full Moon Software30 November 1994Software and documentation © Copyright commstalk, 1994.
