ScriptWizard LITE, version 1.0.1This document was last amended: 30 November 1994Welcome to ScriptWizard LITE. We hope you enjoy using this product. Please consult the ScriptWizard documentation for installation and usage instructions.ScriptWizard LITE is similar to ScriptWizard, but omits the script debugging and find/replace features. CodeWarrior users can upgrade to the full ScriptWizard software for a special low price. See the ScriptWizard order forms on the CodeWarrior CD for full details.Version 1.1 of ScriptWizard and ScriptWizard LITE will ship during the lifespan of the CodeWarrior CW5 CD. Unfortunately it was not ready in time for the CW5 deadline, November 1994. Please see the file "ScriptWizard 1.1 Information" on the CW5 CD for details of the new version of ScriptWizard.CodeWarrior users will be able to download a free update to the new version of ScriptWizard LITE from all major on-line services. ScriptWizard (the full version) users will be able to purchase an upgrade to the new version for a nominal charge (to cover manufacturing costs) if they have purchased after the 1st January 1995. All registered ScriptWizard users will be contacted as soon as the upgrade is ready.Please note that the ScriptWizard documentation mentions a "ScriptWizard Registration Card". There is no registration card for ScriptWizard LITE: as long as you register as a user of CodeWarrior, you are automatically registered as a user of ScriptWizard LITE.Electronic Mailing ListIf you have an electronic mail account, you can subscribe (free of charge!) to an electronic mailing list for ScriptWizard LITE users.
