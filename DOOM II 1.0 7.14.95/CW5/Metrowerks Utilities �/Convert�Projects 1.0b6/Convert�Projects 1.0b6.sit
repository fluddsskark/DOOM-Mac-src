This document is current as of -prerelease- version 1.0b6 of the software, written on September 17, 1994.[Prerelease note: As of 1.0b6, the following limitations apply:		- We •strongly• recommend that before converting a project, that you do a full scan of the source files.  To do this, choose the “Make...” command from the THINK Project Manager’s “Source” menu, un-check the “Quick Scan” check box in the dialog, click “Use Disk”, and when the scan is complete, click “Don’t Make”.	If you don’t do this, you risk running afoul of a bug in the TPM which will cause garbage file names to be returned to Convert•Projects.	This version is a “public beta”; it is substantially feature-complete, and does what it says it does.  It is in need of real field-testing, so if you have problems using it that aren’t covered here, or if you run into anomalous behavior, please contact us (preferably via e-mail).  ]About Convert•Projects----- ----------------Convert•Projects is a utility which will read a THINK C or THINK Pascal product, and produce an equivalent (or nearly so) Code Warrior project.  This is particularly useful for large projects, in which manually adding and segmenting the project would be tiresome or impractical.Convert•Projects does not modify the project documents you feed it, so you can continue to use them, should the need arise.With Convert•Projects, you can convert THINK Pascal version 4.0 or later, and THINK C version 6.0 or later (including Symantec C++ 6.0) project documents.How to Use Convert•Projects--- -- --- ----------------Using Convert•Projects is easy - just drag & drop your project document(s) onto the Convert•Projects icon.  Convert•Projects will read in your THINK C or THINK Pascal project document, locate and analyze the files, and produce a Code Warrior project.  Subject to the preferences settings (see below), more than one project may be produced, e.g.  one for 68K and one for PowerPC.Some files cannot be used by Code Warrior.  Specifically, Code Warrior cannot (and will never be able to) load THINK C project documents that are included as libraries (the ANSI libraries are an example of this); “standard” THINK C library files (created with “Build Library”) likewise cannot be used by Code Warrior, nor can library files created in the MPW ".O" format (including THINK Pascal 3.0 or later library files).  Convert•Projects will exclude these libraries when writing out the new project, and will advise you of the libraries that have been excluded.  It’s up to you to reconstitute those libraries - if the source is available, then include the source directly in the Code Warrior project; otherwise, contact the library vendor for a version that works with Code Warrior.Preferences Settings----------- --------Convert•Projects provides the following settings in its “Preferences” dialog:-	Emit 68K Project: If checked, Convert•Projects will write out a project usable by the 68K versions of the Code Warrior environment.						-	Emit PowerPC Project: If checked, Convert•Projects will write out a project usable by the PowerPC versions of the Code Warrior environment.						-	Remove Missing Files: If checked, Convert•Projects will filter out files that it couldn’t locate when loading the THINK-format project, and advise you of the files that have been filtered.						-	Add Standard Libraries: If checked, standard libraries (ANSI.Lib for Code Warrior C & C++, MW/Runtime.Lib for Code Warrior Pascal) will be added to the created project.						-	Add Toolbox Glue: If checked, toolbox glue (MacOS.Lib) will be added to the created project.-	Ask for Project Name: If checked, Convert•Projects will always ask you (via Standard File) to specify the name and location of each project that it writes out.  Although this compromises the drag-and-drop-ness of the utility, it can occasionally be useful.Limitations-----------The following limitations apply when using Convert•Projects:- Convert•Projects uses the services of the THINK Project Manager to determine the files and segmentation of a THINK C project.  For this reason, you’ll need enough memory so that Convert•Projects can launch the THINK Project Manager.- Although it automates part of the conversion process, Convert•Projects is -not- a “magic bullet” that will get you up and running with Code Warrior in minutes.  How long it takes you to get your programs ported depends on the nature of your code.	- Convert•Projects is not, nor will it ever be, able to convert library files from THINK or MPW formats to the Code Warrior format.  If you have a library which is not available in source or Code Warrior library form, contact the vendor of the library.	- Convert•Projects makes a reasonable effort to locate the files specified in the input projects, and to write out projects such that Code Warrior can readily find the source files.  To help this process, we recommend that you build the project you want to convert, so that all source files’ locations can be determined.  (If you’re using THINK C, bring up the “Make...” dialog, turn off the “Quick Scan” check box, and click the “Use Disk” button.)- Depending on the arrangement of your directory structures, you may need to add some search paths to the Code Warrior project so that Code Warrior can locate all of the files in that project.	- Convert•Projects does not address the issue of resource files; Code Warrior uses the same convention as THINK C for naming the project’s resource file; you should make a duplicate of your resource file and give it the correct name after converting your project.	Miscellaneous Comments------------- --------- Convert•Projects is free.- We plan to keep Convert•Projects up to date as necessary to accomodate changes to Code Warrior.  Therefore, if you have problems with Convert•Projects, please let us know so that we can resolve them.  If Code Warrior has difficulty with a project that Convert•Projects creates, or if Convert•Projects has difficulty processing your projects, we definitely want to know about it.- Please note that we have no plans to turn Convert•Projects into a source converter, and we cannot offer assistance with porting your code to work with Code Warrior.- If you have questions or problems with Convert•Projects, please contact us by one of the following means:		Internet: bbsw@netcom.com	CIS: 73051,3255	AppleLink: BARE.BONES	Fax: (508) 651-7584	Phone: (508) 651-3561	Mail:		Bare Bones Software, Inc.				P.O.
