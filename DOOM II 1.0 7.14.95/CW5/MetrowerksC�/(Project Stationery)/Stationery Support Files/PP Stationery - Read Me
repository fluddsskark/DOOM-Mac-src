ReadMe file for PPStarter stationeryThis is my attempt to create a PowerPlant starter, based on PPobDemo.  Please test this and let me know if it works for you.  I need commentsbefore 11/25/94 to make changes for CW5.It includes 68K and PPC project stationery, a simple resource file, and a framework source code / header file combination.  It compiles andruns, showing the About Box and quitting only.Project includes most of the core PowerPlant classes for interaction, but does not use any Document classes.Resource file has About Box, Apple/File/Edit menus with standard items,and a few Txtr resources.  The creator is set to Constructor, and it'sready for PPobs.CPPStarterApp.h has a very simple subclass of LApplicationCPPStarterApp.cp includes a standard main, constructor (which calls RegisterAllPPClasses), and stubs for ObeyCommand and FindCommandStatus.Again, please get back to me with comments.--------------------------------------------------------------Avi Rappoport                            AviRr@metrowerks.comUser Advocate                            AviRr@aol.comOnline Documentation Lead                AviRr@eworld.comMetrowerks, Inc.
