About the (Project Stationery) folderCodeWarrior 68K and PPC Environments look in this folder for projects to open as stationery in the New Projects dialog.  Choose a project from the stationerymenu and save it with a new name: it will include all the library and preferencesettings from the original. Be sure to make your own folder, save your project there, and put in your own source code.  NOTE: Replace the placeholder source and resource files before compiling.  These files will *not* be found by the environment, as it will not search folders surrounded by parentheses. Stationery Support Files folder contains all source and resource files used to create the stationery.  We don't recommend that you use these yourself, but you could copy them to your folder and test out the environment with them.PowerPlant starter source and resource files are also in the Support Files folder:if you copy them to your project folder, you can follow the tutorial in thePowerPlant Manual.STATIONERY FILESMacintosh C project stationery	Mac C app-68K	Mac C app-PPC	Macintosh C++ project stationery	Mac C++ app-68K	Mac C++ app-PPC	XCMD stationery 	Mac C XCMD-68K	Mac C++ XCMD-68KPowerPlant stationery	PowerPlant 68K	PowerPlant PPC	ANSI 68K 2-byte integer projects	~ANSI 68K (2i) C	~ANSI 68K (2i) C++ANSI 68K 4-byte integer projects	~ANSI 68K (4i) C	~ANSI 68K (4i) C++ANSI 68K 68881 (FPU) 4-byte integer projects	~ANSI 68K (4i/F) C	~ANSI 68K (4i/F) C++	ANSI 68881 (FPU) and 8-byte double 2-byte integer projects	~ANSI 68K (2i/F/8d) C	~ANSI 68K (2i/F/8d) C++	Note: you can mix and match integer, double and 68881 settings.
