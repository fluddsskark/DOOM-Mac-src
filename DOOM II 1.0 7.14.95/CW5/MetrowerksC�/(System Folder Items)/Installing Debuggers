Installing the CodeWarrior Debugger FilesFor debugging 68K code (on 68K Macs or Power Macs)Put the Debugger INIT in your Extensions folder.For drag-and-drop features in the CodeWarrior Debugger with systems before 7.5, install the Macintosh Drag and Drop extension as well.For debugging PPC code (Power Macs only)Put the PPCTraceEnabler and the ObjectSupportLib into your Extensions folder.   For drag-and-drop features in the CodeWarrior Debugger, install the Macintosh Drag and Drop extension as well.  For System 7.5, you don't need ObjectSupportLib and may have already installed the Drag and Drop extension with the system.You must have the PowerMac Debug Services application running before you can use the CodeWarrior debugger.  Therefore, we recommend that you put it in the Startup Items folder in your System folder, so it will start automatically and run in the background.  Otherwise, you can double-click the Debug Services application icon to start it up, and then start the MW Debugger, or allow the MW Debugger to try to launch it.For more information about using the MW Debugger, please see the Metrowerks Debugger Manual in the CodeWarrior Documentation folder, and the MW Debugger Release Notes in the Release Notes folder.-------------------------------------------------------------------------Avi RappoportUser AdvocateMetrowerks, Inc.Bug Reports, Suggestions, and Technical Questions````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````Please send in your bug reports using the email Bug Report, Suggestion or Tech Questiontemplates stored in the release notes folder.
