This startup code is provided to help you understand the CW 68K runtime.In particular, you might want to create a special header for a custom code resource that uses some of this in a non-standard way.  In "Code Resource Examples:Custom Headers:Multi segment DA:" is such anexample.  Other people may want to access the built in hooks in __LoadSeg__ and __UnloadSeg__ for applications.  If you are interested in replacing the shipping runtime, please contact support.
