Welcome to v1.0 of DOOM for the Macintosh!id Software respectfully requests that you do not modify thelevels for the shareware version of DOOM.  We feel that thedistribution of new levels that work with the shareware versionof DOOM will lessen a potential user's incentive to purchase theregistered version.If you would like to work with modified levels of DOOM, weencourage you to purchase the registered version of the game. Make sure you read the DOOM FAQ v6.666 (Frequently Asked Questions)if you have any problems or are anxious to find out about the World of DOOM!------------------------------------------------------------Additional support------------------------------------------------------------If you are looking for external PWADs for DOOM, DOOM2 or Heretic,look no further than the DOOMania!

Before playing, you'll need to read the DOOM manual and this addendum which contains information for playing in Multiplayer mode, as well as technical support and troubleshooting instructions. To avoid compatibility errors, please make sure that your machine and network conform to the system requirements listed below.-------------------------------------------------------------SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS-------------------------------------------------------------DOOMª requires a Macintosh or Macintosh compatible computer witha minimum of a 68040, 68LC040 or PowerPCª processor with 8megabytes of RAM (4500K of free RAM is required), and 6 MB offree hard disk space. A monitor that supports 256 colors/grayswith a minimum resolution of 640 x 400 pixels is required.System 7.1 or later is required. An AppleTalk¨ network, eitherLocalTalk¨ or Ethernet, is required for network play betweenMacintosh computers, and a network that uses the IPX/MacIPXªprotocol is required for network gameplay between Macintoshand PC-compatible computers. A modem that can be set to atleast 9600 baud is required for modem gameplay.DOOM also requires that you have Sound Manager version 3.0 orlater installed. Sound Manager 3.0 is available from a varietyof on-line services, from Apple Computer, and is built intoSystem 7.5 or later. Note that Sound Manager 3.0 is not a"native" PowerPC extension, and will thus slow the executionspeed of your PowerPC-based Macintosh. For best results, upgradeto Sound Manager 3.1 as soon as it becomes available fromApple Computer, Inc.For music while playing DOOM, you will need to have QuickTimeª2.0 or later installed. It is available via some on-lineservices such as Compuserve. QuickTime 2.0 is included with the retail version of Ultimate DOOM or DOOM II, as is SoundManager 3.0.The MacIPXª extension is included with the Ultimate DOOM orDOOM II for the Macintosh,  and will allow you to play DOOM between Macintosh and PC computers over an IPX network, such as Novell NetWare.To play DOOM via a modem, you will need to install a modemtool that is compatible with Apple's Communication Toolbox.Most modems include a Comm Toolbox tool, such as "AppleModem Tool". Follow the instructions in your modem's manualon how to establish a connection.-------------------------------------------------------------IMPORTANT: SETTING OPTIONS-------------------------------------------------------------After launching DOOM, press the "S" key when the logo screensappear in order to access the Single Player options dialog.Press the "M" key to access the Multiplayer options dialog,and to start a Multiplayer game.-------------------------------------------------------------A NOTE ABOUT SYSTEM EXTENSIONS & SPEED-------------------------------------------------------------System Extensions provide functionality not normally built intoyour System Software. There are a number of System Extensionsthat will impact the operating speed of your Macintosh, andtherefore, the speed of DOOM. You should disable all Extensionsand Control Panels that are not needed while playing DOOM. Anumber of extensions, including RAM Doubler, AppleShare, FileSharing Extension, and SpaceSaver, will have a profound impacton the performance of DOOM and should therefore be disabledprior to playing DOOM.To disable your System Extensions and Control Panels, do thefollowing:(Macintosh System 7.5 or later) Open the folder named "ControlPanels" within the System Folder of your startup disk drive.Double-click the "Extensions Manager" icon. (You may be able toselect "Control Panels" and then "Extensions Manager" throughthe Apple Menu.) Each Extension and Control Panel will be listedand can be toggled on or off by clicking the name of the extensionor control panel. A check makr indicates which are currentlyenabled.(Prior to System 7.5) Create a folder within your System Foldernamed "Extensions (disabled)" and one named "Control Panels (disabled)". Drag all your unnecessary Extensions and ControlPanels (respectively) into these folders from the "Extensions"and "Control Panels" folders.Restart your Macintosh.EXTENSIONS YOU NEED: For PowerPCs, we suggest that you disableall Extensions and Control Panels except QuickTime, QuickTimePowerPlug, Sound, Sound Manager, Memory, Keyboard, General Controlsand any "Tune-Up" extensions currently supported by Apple Computer,Inc. A Tune-Up Extension called "Apple Multimedia Tuner" isavailable for the combination of QuickTime 2.0/Sound Manager 3.0,which fixes a number of problems on various Macintosh models.It is included with the Registered version of DOOM. For 68K-based Macintoshes, you should also disable "QuickTime PowerPlug".If you are playing from a CD, you will need to enablethe Apple CD-ROM extension, although you will not need ForeignFile Accessª, or any of the Foreign File Access modules.Some system versions, including System 7.5, have Sound Manager 3.0built in and will not require the Sound Manager Extension. Youmay also have a later version of QuickTime or Sound Manager thanis included with the Registered version. Before replacing any ofyour System Software, you should first try running DOOM. If theneeded version is not available, you will be informed via a dialogthat a certain version is required.PowerPC owners should note that Sound Manager 3.0 is not a "native"System Extension and will thus slow the execution speed of yourMacintosh, especially when music is enabled. The first nativeversion of the Sound Manager will be 3.1, and should be releasedby Apple Computer sometime in 1995 (our estimate, not theirs). Ifyou have a PowerPC-based Macintosh you should upgrade to thatversion as soon as it is available.-------------------------------------------------------------MULTIPLAYER MODE-------------------------------------------------------------GETTING STARTED-------------------------------------------------------------1. Install DOOM as described in the manual. 2. Launch DOOM by double-clicking its icon or by dragging the DOOM1.WAD file on top of the DOOM icon. When the logo screensappear, press the "M" key to access the Multiplayer setupdialog.3. From the Multiplayer setup dialog, enter the number ofplayers that will be playing. A maximum of four people canplay multiplayer DOOM on a network. A maximum of two playerscan play multiplayer DOOM via a serial or modem connection.4. Modem play is implemented through Apple's CommunicationToolbox (CTB). The Registered version of DOOM includes theApple Modem Tool, which may or may not work with yourmodem. Some modems come with a CTB tool. If so, use thetool that came with your modem, or contact your modemmanufacturer to obtain a CTB tool for use with yourparticular model.NOTE FOR PLAYING WITH PC USERS: DOOM 1.0 for the Macintoshis compatible only with Version 1.9 of DOOM for the PC. Makesure your PC friends are using the latest version of thegame before trying to start a multiplayer game.MULTIPLE GAMES ON AN IPX NET: You must be connected to an IPXnetwork and have MacIPX installed in your system to play inIPX multiplayer mode. Before launching DOOM, open the MacIPXControl Panel and select a MacIPX interface (i.e., Ethernet).If you are using the Ethernet interface, double-click theEthernet icon to select the frame type. You must be sure touse the same frame type on all machines. Ethernet 802.3 iswhat most PCs will be using. You should uncheck the "AlwaysAuto-Configure Frame Type" box.To run an IPX network game, select "IPX" from the "Connect via:"pop-up menu in the Multiplayer setup dialog. Then enter thenumber of players. More than one group of players can play amultiplayer game on the same IPX network by using a differentnetwork socket. Valid network socket values are 0 (default)through 64000. Make sure that each player in your game hasentered the same value in the "Network Socket" box. Press the"Start Game" button to begin play.-------------------------------------------------------------MULTIPLAYER INSTRUCTIONS-------------------------------------------------------------Many of the rules for playing DOOM change for the multiplayer game. Read the following information carefully before you begin to play DOOM in multiplayer mode.MENUS: When you activate the Options menu or submenus, the game KEEPS RUNNING so that other players can continue with the action. So it is best to find a safe place before adjusting screen sizes or sounds. Note that on the Macintoshif you hold down the mouse button in the menu bar or customizeyour key commands it will STOP all players (the game will appear"locked", though the mouse can be moved and menus selected).Consider other players when making changes.UNPAUSE: A player may Pause the game by pressing -P,key, but any other player can Unpause the game by pressing -P again. Make sure it's OK with your buddies before taking a breather.SAVE: When you save a multiplayer game, DOOM prompts everyoneto name the file (or select a slot if playing on a PC). Beforesaving the game with PC users, everyone should agree on asafe savegame slot. This does not affect the Macintosh user.LOAD: You cannot load a saved game while playing a multiplayer game. To load a game everyone must quit from the current game and restart the game from the saved game. To start a game from a saved game, you can select it from theMultiplayer setup dialog, or by double-clicking the filein the Finder (before DOOM is running, and remember topress "M" to start a multiplayer game).WEAPONS: When a player runs over a weapon, he picks it up, but the weapon remains in the game for other players to take. Note: Shotguns dropped by former human sergeants are removed from the game after being picked up or smashed.DEATH: If you die and restart in the level, previously taken items and destroyed monsters DON'T reappear. Even though you've died, other players have survived. We didn't want to undo all of their fine destruction by reviving every monster in the area. However, this also means the level will eventually run dry of monsters and ammunition. You'll have to decide when the level is played out.UNIFORM COLORS: In net games, each player's uniform is a different color. The color of your character is the color behind your face on the status bar. The colors are BROWN, INDIGO (black), GREEN, and RED. CHAT MODE: In a multiplayer game you can communicate with other players in the Chat mode. To enter into Chant mode and broadcast a message to all the players, press the letter t. A cursor will appear where your messaging is normally placed. To broadcast to a specific player, instead of pressing t you'll need to press the first letter of the player's color. (B)rown, (I)ndigo, (G)reen, and (R)ed. For example, to send a message to the brown character, you would press the letter b.CHAT MACROS: In a multiplayer game, you can send your ownpre-defined macros (select "Edit Chat Macros" from the "Control"menu) by initiating Chat mode (as stated above), then holding Option and pressing the number key that corresponds to the macro you wish to send. For example, if macro #2 is "Eat it and die!", initiate Chat mode by pressing 'T', then hold down Option and press 2.EXITING A LEVEL: When one player exits a level, all players instantly exit with him, regardless of their position or their status.-------------------------------------------------------------COOPERATIVE OR DEATHMATCH MODE-------------------------------------------------------------There are two ways to play multiplayer--DeathMatch and Cooperative. In Cooperative mode the players work together. In DeathMatch mode your mission is to kill everything that moves, including your buddies. You can choose which mode you wish to play from the SETUP application. The differences between Cooperative and DeathMatch mode are as follows:WHERE YOU START: In Cooperative mode each player begins in the same area. In DeathMatch mode the players begin in completely different areas--if you want to see your buddy you'll need to hunt him down. Plus, each time you die, you'll restart in one of several random locations.KEYS: Unlike in single-player or Cooperative mode gameplay, in DeathMatch mode the players start each location with the keys necessary for opening any locked door in that area.STATUS BAR: In DeathMatch mode the ARMS section on the status bar is replaced with "FRAG." The FRAG section displays the number of times you've killed your opponents.AUTOMAP: In Cooperative mode the Automap works the same way it does in single-player mode. Each player is represented by a different color arrow. In DeathMatch mode you won't receive the pleasure of seeing your opponents on the map. Just like the monsters, your friends could be just around the corner, and you won't know until you face them.SPY MODE: If you're playing in Cooperative mode, press F12 to toggle through the other players' viewpoint(s). Press any other key to return to your view. You still retain your own status bar at the bottom, and if your view reddens from pain it is YOU, not your partner, who has been hit.INTERMISSION SCREENS: In both Cooperative and DeathMatch mode the intermission screen tallies your achievement. In Cooperative mode the intermission screen lists the achievements for all players in the game. In DeathMatch mode the intermission provides a death count on everyone, letting you know who killed whom.-------------------------------------------------------------DEATHMATCH MODE GAMEPLAY NOTES-------------------------------------------------------------The rules for completing or winning a DeathMatch game have intentionally been left general. Any player can exit an area and force all of the players to move to the next area. Also, there is no limit on how many kills are required to declare a player the winner. We decided to leave this up to you. You know what you like best!Note: Before you play DOOM in DeathMatch mode you should be familiar with the layout of every area in DOOM. As you know, in DeathMatch mode your startup location is random and often in an area that is very hostile.-------------------------------------------------------------DOOM OPTIONS-------------------------------------------------------------Much of the information you give to DOOM through the optionsdialog that can be accessed as DOOM is starting up by pressingeither the "S" (single player) or "M" (multiplayer) keys.LOADING WAD FILES: Click the "Load WAD File..." button to eitherswitch to another WAD file (DOOM.WAD, DOOM2.WAD), or to loada external WAD file. Hold the Option key down while clickingthe button to unload all external WAD files.LOAD SAVED GAME: You can load a saved game at the option dialog,or later using "Open..." from the "File" menu. You can alsodouble-click a DOOM saved game file in the Finder (either beforeDOOM is running, or while it is running).TURBO: This setting defaults to 250, and can be set in the rangefrom 0 to 255. 100 is "normal", so entering a value of less than100 will make you move more slowly when turbo is enabled via the"Options" menu. THIS IS CONSIDERED CHEATING IN SINGLE PLAYER MODE!KILL FINDER: The Finder is normally running, however, this optionwill allow you to "kill" the Finder while you play DOOM. Thismakes more memory available for DOOM, as well as minimizing theSystem Software's effect on DOOM.DEATHMATCH: starts DOOM as a DeathMatch game. The default gameis a Cooperative game.ALTDEATH: specifies respawning items during DEATHMATCH. NOTE: Invulnerability and Invisibility do not respawn.WARP: Allows you to specify the level you wish to "warp" to,and takes you directly to that level.MONSTERS: If off, allows you to start playing with NO MONSTERS running around!  This is great for DeathMatch where, really, the monsters just get in the way. Only really useful with "Warp".RESPAWN: Tells DOOM that, yes, you are a badass, and yes, youwant all the monsters to respawn around 8 seconds after you killthem.  The NIGHTMARE skill level already does this. Note that using the Respawn on and Monsters off at the same time is a dumb thing to do.-------------------------------------------------------------Macintosh conversion by Lion Entertainment, Inc.ª-------------------------------------------------------------DOOM, the DOOM logo and DOOM likenesses are trademarks of id Software, inc.,(C)1993.
